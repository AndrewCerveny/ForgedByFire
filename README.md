### Wins:
Prior to this challenge I have never layered an svg or image over another image. It was interesting learning absolute position in CSS. 

### Challenges:
I came across a gitHub challenge at the start of my project I deployed a link. After finishing my project I returning to that link expecting updates. It did not update. I tried many different appraches to get my website to be a current version. Ultimately no success, I deleted my repo made a new one and transferred all of the code i've been building over the last few days. The repo will connect to a page that should be updated. 

### Future Features:
Currently the  page looks different depending on screen size. I built the orginal using a monitor '37 in',  when a user shrinks their computer screen size the website wireframe will get morphed. This website is now built on the user screen being a LapTop screen size. As a future addition learning more about CSS grid and media query and implement dynamic css will make the overal expierence better and more uniform.
